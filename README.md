The goal of this project is to learn and implement big data concepts. We analyzed real world YouTube dataset to obtain patterns and trends and analyzed the likes, views and comments obtained. From a business viewpoint, these data insights can cater to the marketing efforts of a firm and help in understanding which videos or categories of videos might be reaching a wider audience and can manage their advertising accordingly.
